<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<h3>For the Pizza Dough (or use store-bought):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup warm water (105-115°F)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon sugar or honey</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
  <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (or bread flour)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the Pizza:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (or marinara sauce)</li>
  <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
  <li>4 ounces pepperoni slices</li>
  <li>Hot honey (to drizzle)</li>
  <li>Optional: red pepper flakes, fresh basil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Pizza Dough (if making from scratch):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt.</li>
      <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
      <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
      <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
      <li>If using store bought dough, follow the instructions on the package.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
      <li>Roll or stretch the dough into your desired pizza shape (about 12-14 inches).</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
      <li>Arrange the pepperoni slices over the cheese.</li>
      <li>Optional: Sprinkle red pepper flakes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Add Hot Honey and Serve:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle generously with hot honey.</li>
      <li>Optional: Garnish with fresh basil leaves.</li>
      <li>Slice and serve immediately.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips and Variations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For a crispier crust, use a pizza stone or preheat your baking sheet in the oven.</li>
  <li>Adjust the amount of hot honey to your taste.</li>
  <li>You can add other toppings, such as mushrooms, onions, or peppers, to customize your pizza.</li>
  <li>If you do not have hot honey, you can drizzle regular honey, and sprinkle some red pepper flakes on top of the pizza.</li>
  <li>To make your own hot honey, combine regular honey with a small amount of hot sauce, or red pepper flakes, and heat gently.</li>
  <li>For a thin crust pizza, roll the dough out thinner, and reduce the cook time slightly.</li>
</ul>
